# Heesy 2008 reanalysis

This is a reanalysis of data from Heesy (2008), ["Ecomorphology of orbit orientation and the adaptive significance of binocular vision in primates and other mammals"](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/108621). My blog post about it is [here](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/06/011/heesy-2008-reanalysis.html).
